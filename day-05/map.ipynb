    "# Map\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map()` function in Python is a powerful built-in function that applies a specified function to each item in an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a map object (an iterator) of the results. Here’s a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Usage of `map()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`function`**: The function to apply to each item.\n",
    "- **`iterable`**: One or more iterables whose items are passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Basic Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a list of numbers and you want to convert them all to strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "str_numbers = list(map(str, numbers))\n",
    "print(str_numbers)  # Output: ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `str` function is applied to each element in the `numbers` list, converting each number to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Using Lambda Functions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use lambda functions with `map()` for more complex transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a lambda function is used to square each number in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Multiple Iterables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass multiple iterables to `map()` if the function takes more than one argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "numbers2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "summed_numbers = list(map(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers1, numbers2))\n",
    "print(summed_numbers)  # Output: [5, 7, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, corresponding elements from `numbers1` and `numbers2` are added together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Using `map()`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conciseness**: `map()` allows you to apply functions to iterables in a concise and readable way.\n",
    "- **Performance**: `map()` can be faster than using a loop, especially for large datasets, since it’s optimized for such operations.\n",
    "- **Functional Programming**: Fits well with functional programming paradigms, promoting the use of functions and immutability."

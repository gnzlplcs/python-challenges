    "# WHILE LOOP\n",
    "The **`while` loop** in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code **as long as a specified condition is true**. It’s ideal for situations where you don’t know in advance how many times the loop will run. Let’s break it down with examples and practical advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Syntax**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute while the condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `condition` is checked **before each iteration**.\n",
    "- If the condition evaluates to `True`, the code inside the loop runs.\n",
    "- The loop stops when the condition becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "while count <= 5:\n",
    "    print(f\"Count: {count}\")\n",
    "    count += 1  # Increment to avoid an infinite loop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# Count: 1\n",
    "# Count: 2\n",
    "# Count: 3\n",
    "# Count: 4\n",
    "# Count: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Infinite Loops**:\n",
    "   - If the condition never becomes `False`, the loop runs forever.\n",
    "   - **How to avoid**:\n",
    "     - Always ensure the loop has a way to terminate (e.g., update variables in the loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Example of an infinite loop (avoid this!):\n",
    "   # while True:\n",
    "   #     print(\"This runs forever!\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **`break` Statement**:\n",
    "   - Exit the loop immediately, even if the condition is still `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while True:\n",
    "       user_input = input(\"Enter 'q' to quit: \")\n",
    "       if user_input == 'q':\n",
    "           break  # Exit the loop\n",
    "       print(\"You entered:\", user_input)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **`continue` Statement**:\n",
    "   - Skip the rest of the current iteration and check the condition again.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   num = 0\n",
    "   while num < 5:\n",
    "       num += 1\n",
    "       if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "           continue  # Skip even numbers\n",
    "       print(num)\n",
    "   # Output: 1, 3, 5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **`else` Clause**:\n",
    "   - The `else` block runs **after the loop finishes** (only if the loop exits normally, not via `break`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   count = 0\n",
    "   while count < 3:\n",
    "       print(count)\n",
    "       count += 1\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Loop completed!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Output:\n",
    "   # 0\n",
    "   # 1\n",
    "   # 2\n",
    "   # Loop completed!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Use Cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input Validation**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   while True:\n",
    "       age = input(\"Enter your age: \")\n",
    "       if age.isdigit():\n",
    "           age = int(age)\n",
    "           break\n",
    "       print(\"Invalid input. Try again.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Processing Data Until a Condition is Met**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   total = 0\n",
    "   while total < 100:\n",
    "       num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "       total += num\n",
    "       print(f\"Total: {total}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrying Failed Operations**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   max_retries = 3\n",
    "   retries = 0\n",
    "   success = False\n",
    "\n",
    "   while retries < max_retries and not success:\n",
    "       try:\n",
    "           # Attempt an operation (e.g., connect to a server)\n",
    "           success = True\n",
    "       except:\n",
    "           retries += 1\n",
    "           print(f\"Retry {retries}/{max_retries}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Game Loops**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   game_over = False\n",
    "   while not game_over:\n",
    "       # Update game state\n",
    "       user_action = input(\"What will you do? \")\n",
    "       if user_action == \"quit\":\n",
    "           game_over = True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Common Mistakes**:\n",
    "- **Forgetting to update variables** in the loop, leading to infinite loops.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Bad:\n",
    "  count = 1\n",
    "  while count <= 5:\n",
    "      print(count)\n",
    "      # Forgot to increment count → infinite loop!\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- **Off-by-one errors** (e.g., using `<` instead of `<=`).\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Prints 0, 1, 2 instead of 0, 1, 2, 3\n",
    "  count = 0\n",
    "  while count < 3:\n",
    "      print(count)\n",
    "      count += 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Comparison with `for` Loops**:\n",
    "- Use a `for` loop when you know the number of iterations (e.g., iterating over a list).\n",
    "- Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations depends on a dynamic condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways**:\n",
    "- The `while` loop is controlled by a condition, not a fixed sequence.\n",
    "- Always ensure the loop has a way to terminate.\n",
    "- Use `break` and `continue` for finer control over loop behavior.\n",
    "- The `else` clause is unique to Python and runs when the loop exits normally.\n",

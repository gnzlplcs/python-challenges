    "# Exercises with WHILE LOOP\n",
    "Absolutely! Here are a couple of **exercises** to help you practice using `while` loops. These problems are designed to reinforce your understanding and give you hands-on experience. Try solving them on your own, and if you get stuck, feel free to ask for hints or solutions!\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 1: Number Guessing Game**\n",
    "Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess it. The program should:\n",
    "1. Tell the user if their guess is too high or too low.\n",
    "2. Keep track of the number of guesses.\n",
    "3. End the game when the user guesses the correct number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 50\n",
    "Too high!\n",
    "Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 25\n",
    "Too low!\n",
    "Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 37\n",
    "Correct! You guessed it in 3 attempts.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",
    "- Use the `random` module to generate a random number.\n",
    "- Use a `while` loop to keep asking for guesses until the user gets it right.\n",
    "- Use `if` statements to check if the guess is too high or too low.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 2: Sum of Numbers**\n",
    "Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a number. The program should:\n",
    "1. Keep a running total of the numbers entered.\n",
    "2. Stop asking for numbers when the user enters `0`.\n",
    "3. Print the total sum of all the numbers entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter a number (0 to quit): 5\n",
    "Enter a number (0 to quit): 10\n",
    "Enter a number (0 to quit): 15\n",
    "Enter a number (0 to quit): 0\n",
    "The total sum is: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",
    "- Use a `while` loop to repeatedly ask for input.\n",
    "- Use a variable to keep track of the running total.\n",

    "3. Print a message if the user exceeds the maximum number of attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the password: hello\n",
    "Incorrect password. 2 attempts remaining.\n",
    "Enter the password: world\n",
    "Incorrect password. 1 attempt remaining.\n",
    "Enter the password: python\n",
    "Access granted!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",
    "- Use a `while` loop to keep asking for the password.\n",
    "- Use a counter to track the number of attempts.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",
    "- The Fibonacci sequence starts with `0` and `1`. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.\n",

    "7 x 1 = 7\n",
    "7 x 2 = 14\n",
    "7 x 3 = 21\n",
    "...\n",
    "7 x 10 = 70\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints:\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise 6: Factorial Calculator**\n",
